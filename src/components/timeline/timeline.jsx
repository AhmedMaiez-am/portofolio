          improve the workflow for various business processes. I worked closely
          with clients to understand their needs and provided expert guidance on
          automating processes, such as purchase order management, sales order
          invoicing, vehicle transport and parc managing and many more.
          <br />
          Notable achievements include:
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;● Developing custom fields and page
          extensions, such as the automatic generation of purchase lines based
          on free quantities, enhancing order management efficiency.
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;● Creating robust codeunit procedures to
          manage complex calculations and logic for vehicle fuel consumption
          based on vehicle type and mileage data.
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;● Streamlining the reporting processes,
          including adding fields specific fields to datasets and implementing
          multiple selection filters for trip reports.
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;● Collaborating with cross-functional
          teams to integrate the system with external platforms and optimize
          workflows for seamless data exchange between Business Central and
          other business systems.
